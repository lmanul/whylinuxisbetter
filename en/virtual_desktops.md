title: "Too many windows? Use workspaces."
---

I never was a Windows user and there is something I just cannot 
understand: once you have your word processor, your web browser, your 
email application, your instant messenger software and some windows open to 
explore your files, how do Windows users manage not to <b>get lost</b> 
in this clutter?

Workspaces is a feature I would never trade for anything else. You 
probably only have one screen, right? Try Linux, and you have four. 
Well, you can't actually look at the four of them at the same time, but 
this doesn't matter since your eyes can't look in two directions at 
once, right? On the first screen, lets put your word processor. On the 
second one, your instant messenger software. On the third one, your web 
browser. So when you're writing something in your word processor and you 
want to check out something on the web, no need to review all your 
windows to find your browser, stacked all the way behind the others. You 
just switch to your third screen and voil√†, here it is.

Take a look at the following screen, and pay particular attention to 
the bottom right of the screen:

That's your "workspace switcher". You can see it has four (virtual) 
screens, but you can have more than this (I use 12 of them, but some 
people have many more). The one on the left is highlighted: it's the 
current one. To switch to another one, just click on the one you want 
(each one of them shows a small preview of the windows they contain: 
in this case the three others are empty), or use a keyboard shortcut.
