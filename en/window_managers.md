If you're a Windows user, your desktop environment probably isn't 
very far from this:

<img src="/img/window_managers_windows_10.jpg" />

Pretty much all Windows users have the same desktop. You can still 
change your wallpaper, or the color of your windows decorations (default 
is black), but basically you'll still end up with the usual Windows 
interface.

With Linux, choice has been brought back to you. You're no longer 
forced to accept the one-and-only way to manage multiple windows: you 
can choose among many programs, which are called "desktop environments". But 
don't worry, you won't <i>need</i> to worry about that, since you'll 
have a pretty good default. The point is you <i>can</i> change 
it if you wish.

So if you like a simple, efficient and easy-to-use desktop 
environment, you'll probably like GNOME:

<img src="/img/window_managers_ubuntu.jpg"/>

If you like a more modern and glossy look, you might want to switch 
to KDE:

<img src="/img/window_managers_kde.jpeg" />

Or you could try this one, the simple and fast LXQT:

<img src="/img/window_managers_lxqt.jpg" />

Or even a lightweight window manager, if you love to completely customize your desktop 
environment:

<img src="/img/window_managers_wm.jpg" />

As you can see, with Linux <b>you decide what your desktop looks 
like</b>. And you don't even need to decide once and for all : you can 
switch to any of these desktop styles whenever you log into your 
computer.
