Linux has many music players (including AmaroK, Rhythmbox, Banshee, 
etc.), and some of them are <b>great</b>. Check out AmaroK for example 
(see the screenshot): it manages and plays your music perfectly, learns 
which tunes you prefer, automatically fetches their title (and lyrics) 
on the Internet, and even gets the CD covers for you!
