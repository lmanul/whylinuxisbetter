title: "Linux protects your computer"

Viruses, trojans, adware, spyware... Windows lets all these enter your 
computer pretty easily. The average period of time before a Windows PC (connected 
to the Internet and with a default "Service Pack 2" installation) gets 
infected is <b>40 minutes</b> (and it sometimes takes as little time as 30 seconds).

So you can either 1) install a firewall, 2) install an antivirus program, 3) 
install an anti-adware program, 4) get rid of Internet Explorer and Outlook 
(replacing them with Firefox and Thunderbird), and 5) pray that people trying to
get into your computer 
aren't smart enough to overcome these protections and that, if a 
security flaw is discovered, Microsoft will take less than a month to 
make an update available (and this doesn't happen very often). Or you 
can install Linux and sleep soundly from now on.

As we have already said in the "virus" section, Open Source software (e.g. 
Linux) means more eyes to check the code. Every programmer on Planet 
Earth can download the code, have a look, and see whether it might have 
security flaws. On the other hand, the only people allowed to look at 
the Windows source code (its "recipe") are people working for Microsoft. 
That's hundreds of thousands of people (maybe millions) versus a few 
thousand. That makes a big difference.

But actually, it isn't exactly a matter of <i>how many</i> flaws a 
system has, compared to the others. If there are many flaws, but nobody 
has discovered them yet (including attackers), or they are minor (they 
don't compromise an important part of the system), attackers won't be able 
to do great damage. It is really a matter of <i>how fast a security flaw 
can be solved once it has been discovered</i>. If a security flaw is 
discovered in an open source program, anyone in the open source 
community can have a look and help solve it. The solution (and the 
update) usually appears within a few days, sometimes even a few hours. 
Microsoft doesn't have that much manpower, and usually releases security 
patches within about a month after the flaw has been discovered (and 
sometimes published): that's more than enough for attackers to do whatever 
they want with your computer.
