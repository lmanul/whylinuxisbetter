<h2>Use MSN, AIM, ICQ, Jabber, with a single program</h2>

<p>You may have accounts for several instant messaging services, such as 
MSN, Yahoo, ICQ, Jabber, AIM, Facebook chat, etc.
While running Windows or Mac OS X, 
you probably need one program to connect to each one of those : MSN 
Messenger for MSN, ICQ for ICQ, etc.</p>

<p>With Pidgin, the instant messenger for Linux (it exists for Windows 
as well, and for Mac OS X with the name "Adium"), you can connect to all 
these services at once, with this one program, and see all your buddies 
at the same time.</p>
