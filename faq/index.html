<h2>A small FAQ for Linux geeks</h2>

<p>All right, I might start by saying that, as you have probably 
noticed, this website isn't really meant for you :) It's meant for 
Windows (or Mac) users trying to figure out what "Linux" is, what it 
looks like, and see whether there's anything good for them in it. You 
probably won't find any new information here, and you might just as well 
keep on reading slashdot ! :-p </p>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Q: Linux is hardly a full OS like Windows, it's just the 
kernel. Why let users believe otherwise ?</b></p> <p>A: Saint Linus 
please forgive me :) This is voluntary simplification. If you start 
explaining this, the fact that Linux is the kernel's name, and that 
different vendors choose to ship Linux with their choice of software to 
make a "Linux distribution", etc., half of the audience has already 
left. This is not a website for people already using Linux as their main 
OS (unless they want to help out making the site better). For the 
same reasons, and for the sake of simplicity, I don't speak about 
the various BSDs and the fact that many of the <i>big</i> servers 
run BSD and not Linux.</p> 
</li>

<li><p><b>Q: Why are you saying an OS is better than another? It depends 
on what people want to do with it.</b></p>
<p>A: Of course it does, I agree perfectly. But let's be clear about 
what I'm trying to say here: 1) Let Windows/Mac OS X users know 
something else exists out there. 2) Give a few reasons why 
Linux is a really good system, and why most of the time it is a pretty 
good choice. Obviously, the website's name is more straightforward than 
this, but hey, should I have bought 
<tt>whylinuxmaybebetterinmanycases.net</tt> ?</p>

<p>I'm no Linux expert, nor some sect leader, and I don't want to 
evangelise: I'm just an extremely happy user and developer of Linux, 
trying to make more people get to know about Linux.</p>

</li>

<a name="gnu"><li><p><b>Q: It's GNU/Linux, not Linux,
stupid!</b></a></p>

<p>A: On a website for advanced Linux users, details like this would matter,
however I want to keep things fairly simple. People have heard of "Linux", not 
"GNU/Linux", and this kind of geeky quarrel is probably one of the 
things that prevent "normal" people from understanding what this is all 
about. For the same reason, I write "OpenOffice" instead of 
"OpenOffice.org" and so forth.</p>

<p>And by the way, this "Q:" is not a question, since it doesn't 
have a question mark. But anyway, since I write both questions and 
answers... Oh boy, I really am stupid.</p>

</li>

<li><p><b>Q: Man, your English is lousy.</b></p>
<p>A: Yeah, I know. And I'm working on it. Pass the rod, please.</p>
</li>

<li><p><b>Q: You seem to concentrate on GNOME and Ubuntu. Any hard 
feelings about KDE and other distributions ?</b></p> <p>A: Of course 
not. I love and use a lot of KDE apps (if all the efforts put about GNOME 
vs KDE trolls could be invested in nicely integrating KDE apps in GNOME 
and the other way around, I'd be really happy). My screenshots 
mostly show Ubuntu because that's the distribution I use and develop 
for. Needless to say, feel free to send me other screenshots. You might 
notice I have an item about AmaroK, don't hesitate to send me further 
suggestions for other KDE (and GNOME!) apps.</p> </li>

<li><p><b>Q: What the hell do you know about Linux anyway ?</b></p> 
<p>A: Probably not as much as I should! I'm a member of Ubuntu, I have 
been using Linux since ~1998, wrote a few paperback books (in French) about 
Open Source software (Firefox, Linux, etc.). But I'm trying to fix 
that, I just ordered the "Understand the Linux kernel" book (by the time 
you read this, I may have finished reading it, understood all there is 
to know about Linux and want to create my own version, which I'll 
undoubtedly call "Manux" -- okay, maybe not).</p> </li>

<a name="gaming"><li><p><b>Q: You said gamers shouldn't switch to Linux, 
but don't you know about Wine, Cedega, Steam? These work fine for a growing 
number of Windows games.</b></p>

<p>A: I agree that various software solutions make running Windows games 
under Linux much easier than it used to be, and more and more games are 
available natively in Linux thanks to platforms like Steam. However, 
note that I used the expression "hardcore gamers", the ones who buy the 
most recent games and overclock their CPUs to get better performance; I 
doubt that these are willing to make that kind of compromise.</p>

<p>If you're still unconvinced, please try the following thought experiment.
Imagine your best friend is a hardcore gamer. He or she plays games several
hours a day, every day, keeps his/her computer up to date with the most
recent hardware so that games can be played with the highest detail settings
and performance, participates in all the early beta releases, has running
subscriptions to several massively online multiplayer gaming services, etc.
Now imagine this best friend of yours is considering switching to another
operating system, and is asking you for advice, wondering whether Linux is
a possible choice for him/her. Would you say it is? At this point, I'm pretty
sure I wouldn't (yet).</p>
</li>

<p><a name="distros"><li><b>Q: Please add Linux distribution XYZ to your page on installing Linux.</b></a></p>
<p>A: There are many, many distributions out there, and any limited subset couldn't possibly satisfy everyone. For people who want to try out Linux, it's already a little confusing that there are several "versions/flavors" of it. I chose to mention 4 of them that have been and still are among the most popular, I think it is a reasonable choice.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Q: Hey, aren't you that wacky <a 
href="http://www.manucornet.net/pcjacking">PCJacking</a> guy ?</b></p>
<p>A: Woops, yeah.</p>
</li>

<li><p><b>Q: Hey, aren't you that wacky <a 
href="http://www.manucornet.net/Informatique/Gimp_Texturize.php">GIMP-Texturize</a> 
guy ?</b></p>
<p>A: Yeah, you got me :) But <a 
href="http://jb.rouquier.free.fr/">Jean-Baptiste Rouquier</a> also 
did half of the job. Okay, more. Huh, next question please.</p>
</li>

<li><p><b>Q: Hey, weren't you one of those wacky <a 
href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Google's Summer of 
code</a> guys, one of the 400-out-of-9000 chosen hackers ?</b></p> <p>A: 
Yeah. But I just got lucky: I sent 8000 of those 9000 projects 
propositions, and one of them was accepted. Okay, I got lucky twice (2005, 2006). Next year I'm gonna open 
source my automatic project generator. </p> </li>

<li><p><b><a name="help">Q: Hi! I can't make XYZ work on Linux. Can you help me?</a></b></p>

<p>A: I'm sorry, but my email address should not be considered as an unlimited Linux 
support alias :-) Like many other people, I have lots of things to do, and while I'm 
glad to help out when I can and have time for it, I am sure many people out there in 
forums or IRC channels will be more than glad to 
<a href="http://www.whylinuxisbetter.net/items/help/index.php">answer your questions</a>!
And a <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> 
search is always a good place to start.</p></li>
