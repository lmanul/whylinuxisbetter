<h2>When the system has installed, why would you <i>still</i> need to install stuff?</h2>

Installing Windows is just the beginning. Imagine you just installed 
your brand new copy of Windows 7 and prepare to unleash your computer 
skills. A friend sends you an email with an attached PDF file : damn, 
you don't have a program to read it. You need to go online, search for a 
website that will let you download Adobe Reader (or another PDF viewer), 
download it, install it, maybe even reboot. Whew, all right, now you're 
all set. Attached to your friend's email you find a text document, 
file.doc. Your Windows can't read that either, right now: great. Either 
you go buy your copy of Microsoft Office, or you just download 
OpenOffice, but still, you need to find it, download it (let's hope you 
have a broadband connection), install it, etc. Your friend also sent you 
an image, but it has a bad contrast, bad luminosity, and needs a good 
crop. So you can now go and buy Photoshop (how many hundred bucks is 
that again?), or download the GIMP (this is the name of the free 
program that can do nearly as much as Photoshop) : search, download, 
install, etc. That's enough : you get the idea, Windows is far from 
complete, and installing it is just the beginning of trouble.

When you get Linux (such as Ubuntu, Mandriva, Fedora, etc., these are 
different "flavors" of Linux), you also get, <i>without installing 
anything more</i> :

<ul>

<li>Everything you need to write texts, edit spreadsheets, make neat presentations, draw, edit equations.</li>

<li>A web browser (eg Firefox) and an email program (eg Thunderbird, or Evolution).</li>
<li>An image editor (GIMP) nearly as powerful as Photoshop.</li>
<li>An instant messenger.</li>
<li>A movie player.</li>
<li>A music player and organizer.</li>
<li>A PDF reader.</li>
<li>Everything you need to uncompress archives (ZIP, etc.).</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

You can just start working right away.
