title: Are your tired of restarting your computer all the time?
---

Have you just upgraded one or two little things on your Windows 
system with "Windows update"? Please reboot. Have you just installed 
some new software? Please reboot. Does your system seem unstable? Try 
to reboot, everything will probably work better after that.

Windows always asks you to restart your computer, and that can be 
annoying (maybe you happen to have a long download going on, and you 
don't want to interrupt it just because you updated a few pieces of your 
system). But even if you click "Restart later", Windows still keeps 
bothering you every ten minutes to let you know that you really should 
restart the computer. And if you happen to be away from your computer
and you didn't see the question, it will happily reboot automatically.
Bye bye long download.

Linux basically doesn't need to restart. Whether you install new 
software (even very big programs) or perform routine upgrades for your 
system, you will not be asked to restart the computer. It is only 
necessary when a part from the heart of the system has been updated, and 
that only happens once every several weeks.

Do you know Internet servers? They're the big computers that answer 
you when you ask for a web page, and send the information to your 
browser. Most of them run Linux, and since they need to always be 
available (a visitor could come anytime), they aren't restarted very often 
(services aren't available while the system is starting). Actually, many 
of them haven't restarted for <b>several years</b>. Linux is stable, it 
runs perfectly well without restarting all the time.

You'll probably not let your computer stay on for several weeks but the 
point is: the system won't bother you with restarting all the time.
