title: Does your digital life seem fragmented?
---

If you already know what fragmentation is, and are already used to 
defragmenting your disk every month or so, here is the short version : 
Linux doesn't need defragmenting.

Now imagine your hard disk is a huge file cabinet, with millions of 
drawers (thanks to <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~dicosmo/">Roberto 
Di Cosmo</a> for this comparison). Each drawer can only contain a fixed 
amount of data. Therefore, files that are larger than what such a drawer can 
contain need to be split up. Some files are so large that they need 
thousands of drawers. And of course, accessing these files is much 
easier when the drawers they occupy are close to one another in the 
file cabinet.

Now imagine you're the owner of this file cabinet, but you don't have 
time to take care of it, and you want to hire someone to take care of it 
for you. Two people come for the job, a woman and a man.

<ul>

<li>The man has the following strategy : he just empties the drawers 
when a file is removed, splits up any new file into smaller pieces the 
size of a drawer, and randomly stuffs each piece into the first 
available empty drawer. When you mention that this makes it rather 
difficult to find all the pieces of a particular file, the response is 
that a dozen boys must be hired every weekend to put the chest back in 
order.</li>

<li>The woman has a different technique : she keeps track, on a piece of 
paper, of contiguous empty drawers. When a new file arrives, she 
searches this list for a sufficiently long row of empty drawers, and 
this is where the file is placed. In this way, provided there is enough 
activity, the file cabinet is always tidy.</li>

</ul>

Without a doubt, you should hire the woman (you should have known it, 
women are much better organized :) ). Well, Windows uses the first 
method ; Linux uses the second one. The more you use Windows, the slower 
it is to access files ; the more you use Linux, the faster it is. 
The choice is up to you!
