<h2>Is your system unstable?</h2>

<p>Have you ever lost your precious work because Windows crashed? Do you 
always shut down your computer the proper way, or do you sometimes just 
switch it off because Windows has gone crazy and doesn't let you do 
anything anymore? Have you ever gotten the "blue screen of death" or error 
messages telling you that the computer needs to be shut down for obscure 
reasons? </p>

<p>The latest versions of Windows, especially the "Professional" ones 
are becoming more stable than before. Nevertheless this kind of problem still 
happens fairly often.</p>

<p>Of course, no operating system is perfect, and people who tell you 
that theirs can never ever crash are lying. However, some operating 
systems can be so stable that most users never see their systems crash, 
even after several years. This is true for Linux. Here's a good way to see 
this. When a system crashes, it needs to be shut down or restarted. Therefore, 
if your computer can stay up and running for a long time, no matter how 
much you use it, then you can say the system is stable. Well, Linux can 
run for <i>years</i> without needing to be restarted (most internet 
servers run Linux, and they usually never restart). Of course, with 
heavy updates, it still needs to be restarted (the proper way). But if 
you install Linux, and then use your system as much as you want, leaving 
your computer on all the time, you can go on like that for years without 
having any trouble.</p>

<p>Most of the time, you won't leave your computer on for such a long time, but 
this shows how stable Linux is.</p>
