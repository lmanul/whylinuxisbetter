title: Forget about viruses.
---

If your computer shuts itself down without asking you, if strange 
windows with text you don't understand and all kinds of advertisements 
appear when you don't ask for them, if emails get sent to all your 
contacts without your knowing it, then your computer probably has a 
virus. The main reason for this is because it runs Windows.

Linux hardly has any viruses. And that's not like "Oh well, not very 
often, you know". That's like "If you've ever heard of a real Linux 
virus, please tell me". Of course, a Linux virus is not impossible to get.
However, Linux makes it very hard for this to happen, for several 
reasons:

<ul>

<li>Most people use Microsoft Windows, and pirates want to do as much 
damage (or control) as possible: therefore, they target Windows. 
But that's not the only reason; the Apache web server (a web server is a 
program located on a remote computer that sends web pages to your 
browser when you ask for them), which is open source software,
has the biggest market share (against 
Microsoft's IIS server), but it still suffers from <i>much</i> fewer 
attacks/flaws than the Microsoft one.</li>

<li>Linux uses smart authorization management. In Windows you (and any 
program you install) usually have the right to do pretty much anything 
to the system. If you feel like punishing your PC because it just let 
your precious work disappear, you can go inside the system folder and 
delete whatever you want: Windows won't complain. Of course, the next 
time you reboot, trouble begins. But imagine that if you can delete this 
system stuff, other programs can, too, or just mess it up. Linux doesn't 
allow that. Every time you request to do something that has to do with 
the system, an administrator password is required (and if you're not an 
administrator on this system, you simply can't do it). Viruses can't 
just go around and delete or modify what they want in the system; they 
don't have the authorization for that.</li>

<li>More eyes make fewer security flaws. Linux is Open source software, which means that any 
programmer in the world can have a look at the code (the "recipe" of any program), and help out, 
or just tell other developers "Hey, what if blah blah, isn't this a security flaw?".</li>

</ul>
