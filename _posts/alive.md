<h2>Let your old computer have a second life</h2>

Windows requires more and more hardware power as its version number 
increases (95, 98, 2000, Me, XP, etc.). So if you want to keep running 
Windows, you need to constantly buy new hardware. But I can't see any 
good reason for so fast an evolution. Of course, many people need a lot 
of computer power and new hardware and technologies are really helping 
them. But for most users, who surf the web, read and write emails, write 
text files and slides, what's the point of buying a new computer every 
2, 3 or 4 years, apart from letting computer vendors earn more 
money? What is exactly the profound reason why your computer can't 
do any more of what it did perfectly well 5 years ago?

Linux runs perfectly well on older hardware, on which Windows 7 
would probably even refuse to install, or leave you waiting for 20 seconds 
after each click. Of course, Linux won't make a race-winner out of 
your 12-year old computer, but it will run very well on it and allow you 
to perform usual tasks (surfing the web, writing documents, etc.) just 
fine. The very computer that delivers this page to you is not very 
young and runs Linux: if you can read this, then it is up and 
running (and if the website loads slowly, blame my Internet 
connection only).
