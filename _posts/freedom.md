<h2>Freedom!</h2>

Linux and "Open Source" software are "free". This means their 
license is a "free license", and the most common is the GPL (General 
Public License). This license states that anyone is allowed to copy 
the software, see the source code (the "recipe"), modify it, and 
redistribute it as long as it remains licensed with the GPL.

So what do you care about freedom? Imagine that Microsoft disappears 
tomorrow (okay, that's not very likely, but what about in 5 years, 10 
years?). Or imagine it suddenly triples the price for a Windows or 
Office license. If you're tied to Windows, there's nothing you can do. 
You (or your business) relies on this one company, on its software, and 
you can't possibly make things work without it (what good is a computer 
without an operating system?). Isn't that a serious problem? You're 
depending on one single company and trusting it wholeheartedly to let 
something so important nowadays as your computers work the way they 
should. If Microsoft decides to charge $1000 for the next version of 
Windows, there's nothing you can do about it (except switch to Linux, of 
course). If Windows has a bug that bothers you very much and Microsoft 
won't fix it, there's nothing you can do (and submitting bugs to 
Microsoft isn't that easy, see the "Report bugs" section). 

With Open Source, if a particular project or support company dies, 
all the code remains open to the community and people can keep improving 
it. If this project is especially useful to you, you can even do this 
yourself. If a particular bug annoys you, you can submit it, talk with 
the developers, but even better, you can fix it yourself (or hire 
someone to do so), and send the changes back to the upstream developers 
so that everyone gets the improvement as well. You're free to do 
(nearly) whatever you want with the software.
