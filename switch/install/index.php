<h2>Install Linux</h2>

<p>Okay, so you've decided to switch to Linux. You won't regret it!</p>

<p>If you want to keep Windows on your computer (which I recommend, 
in case you change your mind, or in case you find stuff you can only do 
with Windows), Windows is gonna need to share the disk with Linux. 
Then, each time your computer starts, it will let you choose between 
Windows and Linux. </p>

<p>You should first <b>backup all your data</b>. This is extremely 
important. We never know what may go wrong. No, really, I'm not 
kidding. Backup your data, get blank CDs, blank DVDs, another hard 
disk, whatever, but back up your work.</p>

<p>Then you should defragment your hard disk. Right now, your data 
is scattered all around (Windows doesn't manage this very well, 
Linux does much better). After defragmenting (this can take a few 
hours depending on the size of your disk), all the data will have 
been gathered at the beginning of your hard drive (think of it as a 
long linear tape, with a beginning and an end). If your data is gathered 
there, Linux won't have any problem splitting (virtually, of course :) ) 
your hard disk in two, and install itself on the second part. </p>

<p>Okay, you're all set, now all you need to do is choose which 
Linux distribution you want. Linux comes in a lot of different 
"flavors", built by different organizations or companies, with 
different sets of software, differents look & feel, etc. They're all 
Linux, but with different "interpretations". This is not an obvious 
choice, and I can't really help you there (actually, lots of 
people like to argue about their distribution being the best). 
However, here are the four most popular distributions, ranked by <a 
href="http://www.distrowatch.com">distrowatch.com</a> :</p>

<? make_distros_table() ?>

<p>When you have chosen a distribution, download the CD(s) image(s). 
Then, burn it (or them) onto blank CD(s). If you're not sure how to do
this or you'd rather pay a few bucks and get CDs delivered to you, you
can try <a href="http://www.easylinuxcds.com">EasyLinuxCDs.com</a>, they have a
pretty good reputation. Now insert the first one in your CD 
drive, and reboot. Your PC should use the CD to boot ; if it doesn't, 
your BIOS configuration is faulty (see the "Try Linux" section).</p>

<p>After that, just follow the instructions on the screen : they're 
pretty simple and straightforward most of the time !</p>

<p><b>Have a nice time with Linux!</b></p>
