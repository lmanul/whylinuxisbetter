title: Games</h2>

<p>Most games are compatible with Windows, and nothing else. Some of 
them have Mac versions, and some of them have Linux versions (Quake 4, 
Neverwinter Nights, etc.), but most of them just run on Windows.</p>

<p>So if you spend a lot of time playing recent games, you should stick 
to Windows.  But you can still install Linux, keep Windows (see the 
install section), and use both of them, depending on your needs.</p>

<p>If you do like to play games but aren't very demanding on their
recency, note that software like Wine or Cedega can help you run
not-so-recent Windows games under Linux without any problem.</p>

<p>Note the upcoming Steambox will be running a fork of Debian and 
CEO of Valve (Gabe Newell) has pledged to support Linux with all
of the company's games (Team Fortress 2, DOTA 2, Half Life, etc.) and upcoming titles.</p>
